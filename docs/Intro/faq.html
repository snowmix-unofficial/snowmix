		<a name="whatissnowmix"><h3>What is Snowmix?</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>Snowmix is a very flexible and very fast command line tool for dynamically mixing live audio and video feeds. Snowmix supports overlaying video, images, texts and graphic elements as well as suports mixing audio. It offers animation, scripting, advanced clipping, simple blending and pattern gradient blending. <Strong>Snowmix is not an application</strong>, but rather a highly advanced specialized tool. However with the Snowmix libraries and a little imagination, tailoring Snowmix into one, is a walk in the park or a piece of cake if you like.</p>

		<p>Snowmix was original and still is developed by the author to produce Live streaming television from the rocket launches in the Baltic Sea by <a href="http://www.copsub.com">Copenhagen Suborbitals.</a> You can see many of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPzFMJIsp2fOQ_ic5a_zXTA">videos from Copenhagen Suborbitals on YouTube</a>.</p>

		<a name="windows"><h3>What about Snowmix for Windows?</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>Snowmix <strong>has not</strong> been tested on Windows. While the code from
		version 0.5.0 is modified to be able largely to compile with Visual Studio,
		Snowmix depends on
		<a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-bad-plugins/html/gst-plugins-bad-plugins-plugin-shm.html"><strong>shmsrc/shmsink</strong></a>
		modules of <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStremaer</a> and these
		modules depends on
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">POSIX socket based named pipes AF_UNIX</a>,
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap">mmap()</a> and
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory_%28interprocess_communication%29">shm_open()</a>.
		POSIX socket based named pipes and POSIX shared memory are not available on native Windows.
		Nevertheless <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=698657">efforts to port GStreamer shmsrc/shmsink to Windows is underway, but not there yet</a>.
		When these efforts matrialize in a released binary of GStreamer for Windows, Snowmix
		is likely to be releasd for Windows as well.</p>

		<p>Snowmix is distributed for free as Open Source Software and latest versions can be

		Binaries <strong>are not</strong> available.</p>

		<a name="compile"><h3>How do I compile and install Snowmix?</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>Instructions for compiling and installing Snowmix are available on the
		page on how to <a href="../Intro/compileandinstall.html">compile, test and install</a>
		Snowmix. The bootstrap script supplied with Snowmix will offer to check for missing libraries
		and tools and offer to download and install them for you. If you have installed an earlier
		version of Snowmix or want to track the development of Snowmix or want to
		find interesting details, please view the <a href="../Documentation/changelog.html">Changelog</a>.
		Please also take a look at the <a href="../Documentation/releasenotes.html">Release Notes</a>.</p>

		<a name="test"><h3>How do I test Snowmix?</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>Instructions for a
		<a href="../Intro/compileandinstall.html">running a demo test are available here</a>.
		Assuming you have <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables">set the environment variable</a>
		<i>SNOWMIX</i> to the directory of your installed Snowmix file tree as you were
		told when running the boostrap file, then you can now run the Snowmix demo using

	<div class="item">

		<a name="terminate"><h3>How do I shutdown/terminate Snowmix?</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>This is <strong>important</strong>, so please pay attention.
		Snowmix will terminate cleanly if the command <i>quit</i> is executed in either
		the Snowmix console window or through a control connection. If Snowmix on the
		other hand is killed either through an external kill signal or through sending
		a CTRL-C in the Snowmix console window, allocated shared memory will stay allocated
		and in a sense lost. If repeated, Snowmix will eventually allocate all available
		shared memory in a system. <strong>This is bad</strong> and you will need to
		reboot your system or find another way to delete/free allocated shared memory.
		On Linux, you can see and free allocated shared memory using the following commands:</p>

		<code>$ df -k /run/shm
$ rm /run/shm/shmpipe*</code>

		<a name="inifile"><h3>How do I write my own ini file?</h3></a>

		<br/>

		<p>Features of Snowmix that are being changed or removed from Snowmix in
		the next major release, are listed as
		<a href="../Intro/endoflife.html">EndOfLife Announcements</a>.
		A major release is a release where the <i>major version number</i> is changing.
		Releasing 0.5.0 after 0.4.x is a major release while releasing 0.4.5 after 0.4.4
		is a minor release. If Snowmix is stopping supporting a specific syntax of its
		commands, this would result in a major release. When the command syntax is changed,
		normally both the new and the old syntax is available in a new minor release.
		If you are writing your own ini files or are using your own programs to send
		commands and queries to Snowmix, reading the End of Life Announcements
		are important to you.</p>
