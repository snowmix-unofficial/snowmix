		<h1><a name="0.5.1">Snowmix version 0.5.1</a></h1>
		<div class="descr">Released February 9th 2016</div>

		<h3>Overall Theme</h3>
		<br/>

		<p>The overall theme for this
		<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/snowmix/files/">Snowmix release 0.5.1</a>
		is to release GUI programs for
		controlling Snowmix for Live video production. Secondary, this release includes
		a number of bugfixes and smaller improvements overall making Snowmix even more
		stable and dependable for a Live production environment.</p>

		<p><strong>New GUI Programs:</strong><br/> 
		The GUI program <i>snowcub.tcl</i> is no longer included, but have been replaced by
		programs such as <i>snowaudio.tcl</i>, <i>snowscene.tcl</i> and <i>snowoutput.tcl</i>.</p>

		<p>The program <i>snowaudio.tcl</i> is a GUI program that can be used to control and
		mix audio in a live production environment running Snowmix. <i>snowaudio.tcl</i>
		reads its configuration from a running session of Snowmix.</p>

		<p>The program <i>snowscene.tcl</i> is a GUI program that can be used to control and
		mix video scenes in a live production environment running Snowmix. <i>snowscene.tcl</i>
		reads its configuration from a running session of Snowmix.</p>

		<p>The program <i>snowoutput.tcl</i> is a GUI program that can be used to monitor the
		output statistics of Snowmix in a live production environment.</p>

		<p><strong>New commands:</strong><br/>
		The following new commands, enhancements, improvements and bugfixes are included
		in this version. Details can be found in the
		<a href="../Documentation/changelog.html">ChangeLog</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Compile and install:</strong><br/>
		Please see the
		<a href="../Intro/compileandinstall.html">compile and install instructions</a>.
		for version 0.5.1.</p>

		<p>Support for OpenGL is still considered alpha code and not enabled by default.
		To enable
		<a href="../Documentation/guide-glshapes.html">support for OpenGL</a>,
		please run the command before running make:</p>

                <code>./configure --prefix=$prefix --libdir=$prefix/lib --enable-snowmixosmesa \
	--enable-snowmixx11 --enable-snowmixglu --enable-snowmixglut</code>

        <p>The variable $prefix is usually /opt/local for Mac OS X and /usr/local for all others.
        Alternatively use the file bootstrapmin-opengl.</p>
		<code>./bootstrapminopengl</code>

		<p><strong>Tested platforms:</strong><br/>
        	This version of Snowmix has before release been tested on:</p>

		</p>

		<p><strong>Comments on installing on various platforms:</strong><br/>
		Please see <a href="../Intro/compileandinstall.html">compile and install instructions</a> for further details.
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Mac OS X</strong>:The bootstrap script will install all that is needed.</li>
			<li><strong>CentOS</strong>: You need to add rights to do 'sudo' for the user compiling and installing
        Snowmix.  The program snowmix_demo needs encoder and decoder modules for
        GStreamer for H.264 and AAC (unclear how get this).</li>
			<li><strong>Chakra</strong>: Compiles and runs fine, but needs BWidget to run GUI apps. BWidget seems
        not to be available for Chakra although it is for Arch Linux. You may
        be able to download and install BWidget from Sourceforge manually.</li>
			<li><strong>Debian</strong>: Needs package 'sudo' to be installed. Need to add rights to do 'sudo' for
        the user download and install missing tools/libs and for installing Snowmix.
Fedora: Fedora 23. You need to add the rpmfusion repository and install relevant gstreamer
        plugins to run the snowmix_demo. Similar for Fedora 22, but untested.<br/>
        <code>sudo rpm -Uvh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-23.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-23.noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-bad-free-extras \
	gstreamer-plugins-bad-nonfree gstreamer-plugins-ugly gstreamer-ffmpeg \
	gstreamer1-libav gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-extras gstreamer1-plugins-bad-freeworld \
	gstreamer1-plugins-base-tools gstreamer1-plugins-good-extras gstreamer1-plugins-ugly \
	gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1</code></li>
			<li><strong>Mint</strong>:The bootstrap script will install all that is needed.</li>
			<li><strong>PCBSD</strong>:  You need to execute the following command "sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash"
        for the scripts to work. Run all commands in bash rather than other shells.
        No video/image sinks was found for GStreamer1.0 for PCBSD10.2.
        No 'wish' needed for tcl GUI programs was found.</li>
			<li><strong>OpenSUSE</strong>: The package gstreamer-plugins-libav isn't found by zypper. You need to
        find the right version yourself and install it manually. Without it, you may
        miss important decoders such as decoder for H.264 etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Ubuntu</strong>:The bootstrap script will install all that is needed.</li>

		<h1><a name="0.5.0">Snowmix version 0.5.0</a></h1>
		<div class="descr">Released July 31st 2015</div>

		<h3>Overall Themes</h3>
		<br/>

		<p>The overall theme for this Snowmix release 0.5.0 is to make Snowmix installable
		as a regular program. Furthermore the theme is also to add support for
		industry standard OpenGL 3D graphics both Off Screen CPU based and
		hardware accelerated GPU based rendering. In addition to these overall themes,
		this release come with a number of bugfixes, speed-ups, cosmetic changes
		and <a href="../Documentation/endoflife.html">EndOfLife</a> implementations.</p>

		<h3>Why are the Release Notes important?</h3>
		<br/>

		<p>This version's release notes are <strong>especially important to pay attention to</strong> for
		those of you who have been using earlier versions of Snowmix. Because Snowmix
		is now changing its major version number, a long list of commands are
		now changing their syntax or are being retired as earlier made clear
		in the <a href="../Documentation/endoflife.html">EndOfLife announcements</a>.
		Please see the <a href="../Documentation/endoflife.html">EndofLife Announcement</a>
		for this version to see the list of commands and functionality now
		changing or retirering. This is also listed in the <a href="../Documentation/changelog.html">ChangeLog</a>.</p>

		<p>In addition to these changes, it is also <strong>important</strong> to know that from
		this version on, the file names in the ini file given for feed control
		sockets and system socket must be given as an absolute file name starting
		with a leading '/'. This mean that you will have to change this in your
		ini files, if you are reusing ini files from previous versions.</p>

		<p>Snowmix will from this version and on <strong>refuse to run</strong>, if the environment
		variable SNOWMIX has not been set to the install path of Snowmix. By
		default, when Snowmix is running the configure command as part of the
		bootstrap script, the install prefix is set to /usr/local for all but
		Mac OS X and to /opt/local for the latter. If you have an install prefix
		being /usr/local, you must set the enviroment variable SNOWMIX to be:</p>

		<code>export SNOWMIX=/usr/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.0</code>

		<p>If you do <u>not</u> do this, <strong>Snowmix will not work properly</strong>.

		<h3>New Search Path</h3>
		<br/>

		<p>From this version and on, Snowmix will, unless filename is absolute and
		starting with a leading '/', be using a search path when:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>include an ini file for reading
			<li>include a Snowmix library file (slib directory)
			<li>load an image file for reading
			<li>load a dead-image file for a feed (from the frames directory)
			<li>open an audio sink output file for writing
			<li>open an image file for writing
		</ul>


		<p>The search path will contain the following paths in this order:</p>

		<code>Current working directory
$HOME/$SNOWMIX_PREFIX
$SNOWMIX</code>

		<p>If the environment variable SNOWMIX_PREFIX has not been set to a name,
		Snowmix will for Mac OS X use 'Snowmix' and for all other platforms use '.snowmix'.
		If you in your ini file include the following files:</p>

		<code># First file
include ../ini/my_ini_file
# Second file
include ini/my_ini_file
# Third file
include /ini/my_ini_file</code>

		<p>Then Snowmix will for the first file look for my_ini_file in this order:</p>

		<code>'current working directory'/../ini/my_ini_file
$HOME/$SNOWMIX_PREFIX/../ini/my_ini_file
$SNOWMIX/../ini/my_ini_file</code>

		<p>If a file is found, the file will be includeded and no further search
		is done. If all search paths fails, the include command fails. The second file will
		be attempted read as:</p>

		<code>'current working directory'/ini/my_ini_file
$HOME/$SNOWMIX_PREFIX/ini/my_ini_file
$SNOWMIX/ini/my_ini_file</code>

		<p>Third filename is absolute, so Snowmix will only attempt to read the file
		/ini/my_ini_file.</p>

		<p>Because search paths are used when opening a file for writing for audio
		sinks, an absolute file name <strong>must</strong> be used if the file
		does not exist when the file is opened.</p>

		<p>So go over your older ini files and probably remove the '../' for images,
		audio sinks etc. and you will probably also copy your old ini files to
		$HOME/.snowmix/ini/ for Linux and $HOME/Snowmix/ini/ for Mac OS X.
		See also the <a href="../Documentation/changelog.html">ChangeLog</a> for more details on this.</p>

		<p>In addition to the 72 new glshape commands, this version adds the following
		3 commands:</p>

		<code>feed drop <feed id> <n drops>
if exist(image,&lt;image id>)
shape newsubpath &lt;shape id></code>

		<p>Details are found in the <a href="../Documentation/changelog.html">ChangeLog</a>.</p>

		<p>For a list of the new glshape commands, please see the
		<a href="../Documentation/reserved.html">Reserved Command</a> list
		in the section <a href="../Documentation/reserved.html#glshape">GL Shape Commands</a>
		and <a href="../Documentation/reserved.html#glshape">Placed GL Shape Commands</a>.
		Please also see the new <a href="../Documentation/guides.html">Snowmix Guide</a> on
		<a href="../Documentation/iguide-glshapes.html">GL Shapes</a>.</p>

		<p>Snowmix now support installation on CentOS. However see the <a href="../Documentation/changelog.html">ChangeLog</a> for a missing
		component of GStreamer on CentOS.</p>

		<p>This version of Snowmix has before release been tested on:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS amd64 ARMv7</li>
			<li>Linux CentOS 7 15.03 amd64</li>
			<li>Linux Chakra 14.11 Euler amd64</li>
			<li>Linux Debian 7.7.0 amd64</li>
			<li>Linux Mint Cinnamon amd64 17.1, 17.2 amd64</li>
			<li>Linux Fedora Workstation 21 amd64</li>
			<li>Mac OS X 10.09 Maverick</li>
			<li>Mac OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite</li>
		</ul>

		<p>For Snowmix version 0.5.0 on OS X, the OSMesa Context may not work. This may just be a
                linking issue, but the root cause has not been found yet.</p>

                <p>OpenGL has not been tested on the ARMv7 platform. Most implementations
                with ARMv7 offers OpenGL ES as opposed to regular OpenGL. Quite likely only
                few changes to Snowmix will be necessary to get Snowmix to work with OpenGL ES,
                but this is currently untested.</p>

		<h3>Compilation and installation</h3>
		<br/>

		<p>For compilation, please see the page on
		<a href="../Intro/compileandinstall.html">compilation and installation</a>. Please note
		that OpenGL 3D Graphics support is alpha code and not enabled by default. You need to
		enable OpenGL support before compilation to includde OpenGL support. Details are found
		on the page on <a href="../Intro/compileandinstall.html">compilation and installation</a>
		and on the page <a href="../Documentation/guide-glshapes.html#including">Snowmix GL Shape Guide</a>.</p>
